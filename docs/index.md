## OpenML

OpenML is a Software House specialized in cutting edge Machine Learning applications.

The company is one year old, but has already established itself as a big player in the new AI revolution.

The company's main and only product is a successfull SAAS ML Framework API that allows users to easily train various types of models.

Although when founded the company proved to be a rising star, since a year has passed OpenML is looking into expanding it's product lineup into a new direction.

## Tyr Framework

An interest has peaked into an article exploring a Distributed Federated Learning algorithm that allows full data privacy between participating peers.

With the goal of creating a propriatary Framework to easily execute this algorithm with companies and organizations as peers (as in OpenML's clients) the project 'Tyr Framework' was conceived.

The name 'Tyr' comes from the Norse god of war, justice, and law. The name seemed fitting the framework allows 'enemies' as in competitors who work in similar fields, to collaborate on a common goal without disclosing valuable data.
