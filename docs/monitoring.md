During the project execution it is important to keep track of the project's progress.

## Project Status Data

Data on the project's status is retrieved in various ways:

- Reports:
    - Current Period Reports
    - Cumulative Reports
    - Exception Reports
- Updated Gantt Chart
- Earned Value (considering hour/man)
- Updated Issues Log

## Escalation Strategy

For every problem in project status the following escalation is used to try and solve or dampen the problem's consequences:

1. No actions required (available slack used)
2. Analyse activity dependencies to try to compress the schedule
3. Reassign resources to critical path
4. Try to obtain additional resources
5. Consider a timeline extension
6. Consider scope reduction
