## PMLC Model Choice

OpenML has is no stranger to Agile developing frameworks and managing projects centered on cutting edge technology. Still the project manager recognizes the advantages of traditional project management life cycles.

The two possible main approaches considered are Agile and Traditional(Waterfall).

The Tyr Framework project has many characteristics to consider when choosing the PMLC model:

- Agile:
    - Pros:
        - Machine Learining in the modern sense is still a pretty untreaded field. Revolutionary advancements in the state of the art could happen any day and client expectations can vary deeply as the technology matures.
        - A possible approach would be to initially develop the project only internally with possibly not a big involvement from clients untill later in the project life cycle. An Agile approach would enable sharp and quick updates to the requirements as client feedback is gathered.
    - Cons:
        - Bigger planning overhead.
        - Higher scope controll necessary to keep scope creep in check.
        - Possibilty of client involvement disabeling cutting edge explorations due to lack of vision.
- Traditional:
    - Pros:
        - Clear requirements defined in advance.
        - Definitive planning enables a more efficient usage of resources.
    - Cons:
        - Higher cost of scope updates.
        - Higher chance of client unsatisfaction or product's market failure.

Given the pros and cons considered, a hybrid approach is choosen
