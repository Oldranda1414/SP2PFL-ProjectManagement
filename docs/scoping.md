Given the project's initial informal proposal, it is clearly a 'Product Development Project' (in contrast to the more common 'Client Delivery Project'). This type of project is similar to the main product sold by OpenML to it's customers so the company is adept to it's quirks.

## Project Scoping Meetings

To kick off the Scoping Phase of the project it is crucial to arrange up Project Scoping Meetings to gather necessary information and produce initial deliverables.

Given the nature of the project there are no clients to involve in the Scoping Meetings, so the participants are 'internal' to the company.

The expected deliverables expected to be produced at the end of the meetings are:

- List of Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS)
- Requirement Breakdown Structure (RBS)
- Choice of PMLC Model to adopt
- Project Overview Statement (POS)

### Meetings Details

Given the high man/hour cost of meetings, two possible approaches are considered to minimize time investment:

- Many meetings with different participants, with the goal of grouping participants with similar schedules and expertise, minimizing scheduling conflicts
- Few meetings with all participants, but with a lower partecipant total, preferring representatives of groups instead of all members

Given the low personnel count of OpenML the second approach is chosen.

The following table lists the participants of the meetings and their roles.

| Name       | Role                        | Reasoning                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| A. Tyr     | Project Manager             | The figure selected to eventualy manage the project   |
| B. Saga    | Customer Experience Analyst | Expert representing market concerns and opinions      |
| C. Mimir   | Technical Lead              | Technician representing the eventual development team |
| D. Freyr   | Finance Manager             | Consulting on budgeting aspects of the project        |
| E. Forseti | Legal Advisor               | Ensures legal constraints are considered              |

The Project Manager (PM) will also serve as moderator/facilitator during the meetings.

Given the scope of work (pun intended) to be undertaken during the meetings an initial scheduling of 3 meetings is set, with the possibility of arranging more meetings if necessary.

To aid in the meetings' execution a template is used to keep track of the progress.

## PMLC Model Choice

OpenML is no stranger to Agile developing frameworks and managing projects centered on cutting edge technology. Still, the project manager recognizes the advantages of traditional project management life cycles.

The two main approaches considered are Agile and Traditional (Waterfall).

The Tyr Framework project has many characteristics to consider when choosing the PMLC model:

- Agile:
    - Pros:
        - Machine Learining in the modern sense is still a pretty untreaded field. Revolutionary advancements in the state of the art could happen any day and client expectations can vary deeply as the technology matures.
        - A possible approach would be to initially develop the project only internally with possibly not a big involvement from clients untill later in the project life cycle. An Agile approach would enable sharp and quick updates to the requirements as client feedback is gathered.
    - Cons:
        - Bigger planning overhead.
        - Higher scope controll necessary to keep scope creep in check.
        - Possibilty of client involvement disabeling cutting edge explorations due to lack of vision.
- Traditional:
    - Pros:
        - Clear requirements defined in advance.
        - Definitive planning enables a more efficient usage of resources.
    - Cons:
        - Higher cost of scope updates.
        - Higher chance of client unsatisfaction or product's market failure.

Given the pros and cons considered, a hybrid approach is choosen (iterative) TODO refine this
