## Project Kick-Off Meeting

A project kick-off meeting is scheduled with the full project team set to partecipate.

This is the high level agenda for the meeting:

- Introduction
- Project Overview
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Presentation
- Team Member Introductions
- Main Milestones Schedule Presentation
- Closing Remarks

The main goal of the kick-off meeting is to have all the team members meet and make sure everyone is on the same page when launching the project's execution phase.

## Team Operating Guidelines

Team operating guidelines are defined to provide a template driven resolution approach.

### Problem Solving

A five step approach is used when approaching problem solving between team members:

1. Define the problem and it's owner
2. Analyse causes and brainstorm solutions
3. Pick a solution
4. Implement the choosen solution
5. Review and document the problem, solution and results

### Decision Making

The decision making style choosen is the Consultative style, where the person responsible makes the decision but is encouraged to gather counsel from appropriate team members. This is choosen to provide the freedom of decision making to all members while encouraging collaboration when deemed necessary.

### Project Meetings

Three type of meetings are to be held:

- Daily status meetings
- Problem resolution meetings
- Project review meetings

Informal 2-3 member meetings are recognized and accepted when deemed necessary, due to the small team dimension.

## RASCI Table

A RASCI table can help identify responsabilities of each team member with regards to project activities. Since the team is pretty small and activities are grouped by category the responsabilities are divided by activity category instead of for every single activity.

| Activity Group                                     | Responsible (R)         | Accountable (A) | Supportive (S)                                 | Consulted (C)                                                    | Informed (I)                                             |
