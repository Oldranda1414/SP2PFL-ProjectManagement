Once the POS is approved, the Planning phase can start.

## Joint Project Planning Sessions

Joint Project Planning Sessions (JPPS) are scheduled. The entire development team and project manager will partecipate to these meetings.

The PM schedules and organizes the meetings deciding:

- Attendees: The entire development team (10 members), Finance Manager, Customer Experience Analyst and the PM himself
- Facilities: The meeting room in OpenML offices is spacious enough for the JPPS to take place
- Equipment: The meeting room provides a wide round table with enough seats for all attendees. Office laptops and pen and paper will be provided

### Agenda

The following Agenda will be carried out throughout the JPPSs

1. Introduction
    - Introduction of attendees
    - Introduction of project
    - Introduction of the agenda
2. Project Analysis
    - Develop of Work Breakdown Structure
    - Construct of Dependency Diagram
    - Construct of Network Diagram
    - Schedule Compression
3. Risk and Resource Planning
    - Risk Assessment
    - Resource Allocation
4. Documentation
    - Draft of Project Definition Statement
    - Writing of Project Proposal
    - Summarise Project Notebook

### Deliverables

The deliverables expected to be produced at the end of the meetings are:

- Project Definition Statement (PDS)
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Required Resources
- Resource Allocation
- Estimate Activity Duration
- Project Network Schedule
- Activity Scheduling
- Project Notebook
- Project proposal

## Work Breakdown Structure

Activities are constructed to represent the work to be done to satisfy the requirements expressed by the user stories.

Since the relationship between user stories and activities is non trivial Requirements Traceability Matrixes (RTM) are used to highlight these relationships.
