## Work Breakdown Structure

Activities are constructed to represent the work to be done to satisfy the requirements expressed by the user stories.

Since the relationship between user stories and activities is non trivial Requirements Traceability Matrixes (RTM) are used to highlight these relationships.

Since some activities are totally fully they do not have a user story related.
